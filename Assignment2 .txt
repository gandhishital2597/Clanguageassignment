Assignment 2 : Introduction To Programming 




**1.) Write an essay covering the history and evolution of C programming. Explain**

**its importance and why it is still used today?**

**Ans)**Here's a comprehensive essay on the history, evolution, and enduring relevance of the C programming language:

The History and Evolution of C Programming



\&nbsp;Origins and Development

The C programming language was born out of necessity and innovation in the early 1970s. Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972, C evolved from earlier languages like \\\*\\\*BCPL\\\*\\\* (Basic Combined Programming Language) and \\\*\\\*B\\\*\\\*, which were designed for system programming but lacked robust features like data types and structured programming constructs.

Ritchie’s goal was to create a language that could be used to write the UNIX operating system, which had previously been implemented in assembly language. By 1973, UNIX was successfully rewritten in C, showcasing the language’s power, portability, and efficiency.



\&nbsp;Standardization and Evolution







As C gained popularity, it underwent several standardization efforts and revisions:

| Year | Version | Key Features |



|------|---------|--------------|



| 1978 | K\\\&R C | Defined by Kernighan \\\& Ritchie’s book, established early syntax and semantics |



| 1989 | ANSI C (C89) | Introduced function prototypes, standard libraries, and stricter type checking |



| 1999 | C99 | Added inline functions, variable-length arrays, and new data types like `long long` |



| 2011 | C11 | Introduced multithreading, Unicode support, and improved safety features |



| 2018 | C17 | Minor revisions and bug fixes to C11 |



| 2023 | C23 | Latest update with modern features like `nullptr`, binary literals, and better hardware support |







These updates reflect C’s adaptability to changing computing needs while preserving its core design principles.

\&nbsp;Importance of C Programming

\&nbsp;Foundational Influence

C is often called the "mother of all programming languages" because it has directly influenced many modern languages, including \\\*\\\*C++\\\*\\\*, \\\*\\\*Java\\\*\\\*, \\\*\\\*C#\\\*\\\*, \\\*\\\*Python\\\*\\\*, and \\\*\\\*JavaScript\\\*\\\*. Its syntax, control structures, and modular design laid the groundwork for these languages.







\* **System-Level Power**

C provides low-level memory access and direct manipulation of hardware, making it ideal for system programming. Operating systems, embedded systems, and device drivers are frequently written in C due to its performance and control.







**Portability and Efficiency**

C’s design emphasizes portability across platforms and efficient execution. Programs written in C can be compiled on various machines with minimal changes, which is crucial for cross-platform development.



\* **Why C Is Still Used Today**

Despite the rise of high-level languages, C remains relevant for several reasons:







\\- \\\*\\\*Performance\\\*\\\*: C programs run close to the hardware, offering speed and efficiency unmatched by many modern languages.



\\- \\\*\\\*Legacy Systems\\\*\\\*: Many critical systems and applications are built in C, requiring ongoing maintenance and updates.



\\- \\\*\\\*Embedded Systems\\\*\\\*: C dominates in microcontroller programming and IoT devices due to its minimal runtime and hardware control.



\\- \\\*\\\*Education\\\*\\\*: C is widely taught in computer science curricula for its clarity in illustrating core programming concepts like memory management, pointers, and data structures.



&nbsp;**Conclusion**

C programming has stood the test of time, evolving from a tool for building UNIX to a cornerstone of modern computing. Its simplicity, power, and influence make it not just a historical artifact but a living, breathing part of today’s software ecosystem. Whether you're building an operating system or learning to code for the first time, C remains a vital language that continues to shape the digital world.

**Ans)** Sure! Let’s break down the \*\*basic structure of a C program\*\* and explain its key components: \*\*headers, main function, comments, data types, and variables\*\* — with examples.

\## 🔹 1. \*\*Basic Structure of a C Program\*\*

\#include <stdio.h>

int main() { // Main function - program execution starts here

&nbsp; int age = 25; // Integer variable

&nbsp; float height = 5.9; // Float variable

&nbsp; char grade = 'A'; // Character variable



&nbsp; printf("Age: %d\\n", age); // Print integer

&nbsp; printf("Height: %.1f\\n", height); // Print float

&nbsp; printf("Grade: %c\\n", grade); // Print character



&nbsp; return 0; // Exit status of the program

}



&nbsp;🔹 2. \*\*Explanation of Components\*\*



&nbsp;1. Header Files\*\*



\* `#include <stdio.h>`: Preprocessor directive that includes \*\*Standard Input/Output\*\* header file.

\* Used for functions like `printf()`, `scanf()`, etc.



\### \*\*2. Comments\*\*



\* \*\*Single-line comment\*\*: `// This is a comment`

\* \*\*Multi-line comment\*\*:



&nbsp;

&nbsp; /\*

&nbsp; This is a comment

&nbsp; across multiple lines

&nbsp; \*/

&nbsp; ```



3\. `main()` Function\*\*



\* Every C program must have a `main()` function.

\* It is the \*\*entry point\*\* of the program.

\* Syntax:



&nbsp; ```c

&nbsp; int main() {

&nbsp; // code here

&nbsp; return 0;

&nbsp; }

&nbsp; ```



&nbsp;\*\*4. Data Types\*\*



| Data Type | Description | Example |

| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

| `int` | Integer numbers | `int age = 20;` |

| `float` | Decimal numbers | `float pi = 3.14;` |

| `char` | Single characters | `char grade = 'A';` |

| `double` | Large/precise decimals | `double big = 3.141592653;` |

| `void` | No return type | Used for functions not returning a value |



\*\*5. Variables\*\*



\* Used to \*\*store data\*\*.

\* Must be declared with a \*\*data type\*\*.

\* Example:



&nbsp; ```c

&nbsp; int number = 10;

&nbsp; float rate = 5.5;

&nbsp; char symbol = 'Z';

&nbsp; ```



---



🔹 3. Example: Simple C Program



```c

\#include <stdio.h>



int main() {

&nbsp; // Declare variables

&nbsp; int num = 10;

&nbsp; float price = 99.99;

&nbsp; char letter = 'X';



&nbsp; // Display variables

&nbsp; printf("Number: %d\\n", num);

&nbsp; printf("Price: %.2f\\n", price);

&nbsp; printf("Letter: %c\\n", letter);



&nbsp; return 0;

}

```



\### Output:

Number: 10

Price: 99.99

Letter: X

**5)Explain decision-making statements in C (if, else, nested if-else, switch).**

**Provide examples of each.**

**Ans)**



Here's a clear explanation of the \*\*decision-making statements\*\* in C, including `if`, `else`, `nested if-else`, and `switch`, along with \*\*examples\*\* of each:



---



\## ✅ 1. \*\*`if` Statement\*\*



The `if` statement executes a block of code \*\*only if a condition is true\*\*.



\### 🔹 Syntax:



```c

if (condition) {

&nbsp; // code to execute if condition is true

}

```



\### 🔹 Example:



```c

int age = 18;



if (age >= 18) {

&nbsp; printf("You are eligible to vote.\\n");

}

```



---



\## ✅ 2. \*\*`if...else` Statement\*\*



Executes one block of code \*\*if the condition is true\*\*, another block \*\*if it's false\*\*.



\### 🔹 Syntax:



```c

if (condition) {

&nbsp; // code if true

} else {

&nbsp; // code if false

}

```



\### 🔹 Example:



```c

int number = 7;



if (number % 2 == 0) {

&nbsp; printf("Even number\\n");

} else {

&nbsp; printf("Odd number\\n");

}

```



---



\## ✅ 3. \*\*Nested `if...else` Statement\*\*



You can place `if` or `if...else` statements \*\*inside another `if` or `else` block\*\*.



\### 🔹 Syntax:



```c

if (condition1) {

&nbsp; if (condition2) {

&nbsp; // code if both conditions are true

&nbsp; } else {

&nbsp; // code if condition1 is true but condition2 is false

&nbsp; }

} else {

&nbsp; // code if condition1 is false

}

```



\### 🔹 Example:



```c

int marks = 85;



if (marks >= 50) {

&nbsp; if (marks >= 80) {

&nbsp; printf("Grade: A\\n");

&nbsp; } else {

&nbsp; printf("Grade: B\\n");

&nbsp; }

} else {

&nbsp; printf("Fail\\n");

}

```



---



\## ✅ 4. \*\*`switch` Statement\*\*



The `switch` statement checks a variable \*\*against multiple values (cases)\*\*. It's a cleaner alternative to long `if-else` chains when checking for \*\*discrete values\*\*.



\### 🔹 Syntax:



```c

switch (expression) {

&nbsp; case value1:

&nbsp; // code

&nbsp; break;

&nbsp; case value2:

&nbsp; // code

&nbsp; break;

&nbsp; default:

&nbsp; // code if no cases match

}

```



\### 🔹 Example:



```c

int day = 3;



switch (day) {

&nbsp; case 1:

&nbsp; printf("Monday\\n");

&nbsp; break;

&nbsp; case 2:

&nbsp; printf("Tuesday\\n");

&nbsp; break;

&nbsp; case 3:

&nbsp; printf("Wednesday\\n");

&nbsp; break;

&nbsp; default:

&nbsp; printf("Invalid day\\n");

}

```



---



\## ✅ Summary Table



| Statement | Use Case | Supports multiple conditions? |

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |

| `if` | When a condition is either true or false | No |

| `if...else` | When there's one alternative | No |

| `nested if` | When decisions depend on multiple checks | Yes |

| `switch` | When checking a variable against fixed values | Yes (for exact matches) |

**6) Compare and contrast while loops, for loops, and do-while loops. Explain the**

**scenarios in which each loop is most appropriate.**



Ans)Here's a \*\*comparison of `while`, `for`, and `do-while` loops in C\*\*, including \*\*key differences\*\*, \*\*syntax\*\*, and \*\*appropriate use cases\*\* for each:



---



\## ✅ 1. \*\*`while` Loop\*\*



\### 🔹 Syntax:



```c

while (condition) {

&nbsp; // code block

}

```



\### 🔹 Key Characteristics:



\* \*\*Entry-controlled loop\*\*: condition is checked \*\*before\*\* the loop body runs.

\* Executes \*\*0 or more times\*\* depending on the condition.

\* Ideal when \*\*the number of iterations is not known\*\* in advance.



\### 🔹 Example:



```c

int i = 1;

while (i <= 5) {

&nbsp; printf("%d\\n", i);

&nbsp; i++;

}

```



---



\## ✅ 2. \*\*`for` Loop\*\*



\### 🔹 Syntax:



```c

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {

&nbsp; // code block

}

```



\### 🔹 Key Characteristics:



\* Also an \*\*entry-controlled loop\*\*.

\* Combines initialization, condition, and update in one line.

\* Best used when the \*\*number of iterations is known or counted\*\*.



\### 🔹 Example:



```c

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {

&nbsp; printf("%d\\n", i);

}

```



---



\## ✅ 3. \*\*`do-while` Loop\*\*



\### 🔹 Syntax:



```c

do {

&nbsp; // code block

} while (condition);

```



\### 🔹 Key Characteristics:



\* \*\*Exit-controlled loop\*\*: the loop body executes \*\*at least once\*\*, even if the condition is false.

\* Useful when you need to \*\*run the loop body before checking the condition\*\*.



\### 🔹 Example:



```c

int i = 1;

do {

&nbsp; printf("%d\\n", i);

&nbsp; i++;

} while (i <= 5);

```

\## 🟨 Comparison Table



| Feature | `while` Loop | `for` Loop | `do-while` Loop |

| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

| Condition checked | Before the loop body | Before the loop body | After the loop body |

| Loop execution | 0 or more times | 0 or more times | \*\*1 or more times\*\* |

| Syntax | Simple | All control in one line | Needs `do` and `while` |

| Use when | Condition-based repetition | Count-based repetition | At least one execution is required |

| Initialization | Outside the loop | Inside loop header | Outside or inside |



---



\## 🎯 When to Use Which?



\### ✅ Use `for` loop when:



\* You \*\*know how many times\*\* the loop should run.

\* Example: printing numbers from 1 to 10, looping through array indices.



\### ✅ Use `while` loop when:



\* You \*\*don’t know in advance\*\* how many times to loop.

\* The loop should continue \*\*based on a condition\*\*.

\* Example: reading input until the user types "exit".



\### ✅ Use `do-while` loop when:



\* You need the loop body to \*\*execute at least once\*\*, regardless of the condition.

\* Example: menu-driven programs, input validation.



---



\## ✅ Quick Examples Summary



\### `while`:



```c

while (user\_input != 0) {

&nbsp; // repeat until user enters 0

}

```



\### `for`:



```c

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

&nbsp; // run 10 times

}

```



\### `do-while`:

**7) Explain the use of break, continue, and goto statements in C. Provide**

**examples of each.**

**Ans)**Here’s a detailed explanation of the \*\*`break`\*\*, \*\*`continue`\*\*, and \*\*`goto`\*\* statements in \*\*C\*\*, including what they do, when to use them, and code examples for each.



---



\## ✅ 1. `break` Statement



\### 🔹 Purpose:



\* The `break` statement is used to \*\*immediately exit\*\* from a `loop` (`for`, `while`, or `do-while`) or a `switch` statement.

\* Control jumps to the first statement \*\*after\*\* the loop or `switch`.



\### 🔹 Syntax:



```c

break;

```



\### 🔹 Example: Exiting a loop early



```c

\#include <stdio.h>



int main() {

&nbsp; for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {

&nbsp; if (i == 5) {

&nbsp; break; // Exit the loop when i == 5

&nbsp; }

&nbsp; printf("%d\\n", i);

&nbsp; }

&nbsp; return 0;

}

```



\### 🔹 Output:



```

1

2

3

4

```



---



\## ✅ 2. `continue` Statement



\### 🔹 Purpose:



\* The `continue` statement is used to \*\*skip the current iteration\*\* of a loop and move directly to the \*\*next iteration\*\*.

\* It does \*\*not exit\*\* the loop.



\### 🔹 Syntax:



```c

continue;

```



\### 🔹 Example: Skipping a specific condition



```c

\#include <stdio.h>



int main() {

&nbsp; for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {

&nbsp; if (i == 3) {

&nbsp; continue; // Skip printing when i == 3

&nbsp; }

&nbsp; printf("%d\\n", i);

&nbsp; }

&nbsp; return 0;

}

```



\### 🔹 Output:



```

1

2

4

5

```



---



\## ✅ 3. `goto` Statement



\### 🔹 Purpose:



\* The `goto` statement transfers control \*\*unconditionally\*\* to a labeled statement in the program.

\* It can be used to \*\*jump forward or backward\*\* in the code.

\* ⚠️ Use of `goto` is \*\*discouraged\*\* in modern C programming because it can make code \*\*difficult to read and debug\*\*.



\### 🔹 Syntax:



```c

goto label\_name;



...



label\_name:

&nbsp; // code

```



\### 🔹 Example: Jumping to a label



```c

\#include <stdio.h>



int main() {

&nbsp; int num = 1;



&nbsp; if (num == 1) {

&nbsp; goto skip; // Jump to label "skip"

&nbsp; }



&nbsp; printf("This line will be skipped.\\n");



skip:

&nbsp; printf("Jumped to the label.\\n");



&nbsp; return 0;

}

```



\### 🔹 Output:



```

Jumped to the label.

```

\## 🟩 Summary Table



| Statement | Use Case | Effect |

| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |

| `break` | Exiting a loop or `switch` early | Terminates the loop or `switch` immediately |

| `continue` | Skipping part of a loop iteration | Moves to the next loop iteration |

| `goto` | Jumping to a labeled part of the code | Transfers control unconditionally |



---



\## ✅ When to Use:



| Use Case | Recommended Statement |

| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |

| Exit a loop when a condition is met | `break` |

| Skip a loop step without exiting | `continue` |

| Jump in special or rare logic cases | `goto` (with caution) |

**9)Explain the concept of arrays in C. Differentiate between one-dimensional and**

**multi-dimensional arrays with examples**

**Ans)**

**Sure! Let's go over the \*\*concept of arrays in C\*\*, and the difference between \*\*one-dimensional\*\* and \*\*multi-dimensional arrays\*\*, with \*\*clear examples\*\*.**



**---**



**## ✅ What is an Array in C?**



**An \*\*array\*\* is a \*\*collection of elements of the same data type\*\* stored in \*\*contiguous memory locations\*\*.**



**\* Instead of declaring many variables (e.g., `int mark1, mark2, mark3;`), you can declare one array like:**



**```c**

**int marks\[3];**

**```**

**\* Arrays allow you to \*\*store and manage multiple values\*\* under a single name.**



**---**



**## ✅ 1. One-Dimensional Array (1D Array)**



**### 🔹 Definition:**



**A 1D array is a \*\*list of elements\*\* of the same type, accessed using a \*\*single index\*\*.**



**### 🔹 Syntax:**



**```c**

**data\_type array\_name\[size];**

**```**

**10)Explain what pointers are in C and how they are declared and initialized. Why**

**are pointers important in C?**

**Ans) ### ✅ What Are Pointers in C?**



**A \*\*pointer\*\* in C is a variable that \*\*stores the memory address\*\* of another variable.**

**Instead of holding a data value directly, it holds the \*\*location (address)\*\* where the data is stored.**



**---**



**## 🔹 Why Are Pointers Important in C?**



**Pointers are powerful and essential in C programming because they:**



**\* Enable \*\*direct memory access and manipulation\*\***

**\* Allow \*\*efficient array and string handling\*\***

**\* Enable \*\*dynamic memory allocation\*\* (`malloc`, `calloc`, etc.)**

**\* Are required for \*\*function arguments by reference\*\***

**\* Enable the creation of \*\*complex data structures\*\* like linked lists, trees, and graphs**



**---**



**## ✅ How to Declare and Initialize a Pointer**



**### 🔹 Declaration Syntax:**



**```c**

**data\_type \*pointer\_name;**

**```**



**> The `\*` indicates it's a pointer to the specified data type.**



**### 🔹 Example:**



**```c**

**int a = 10;**

**int \*p; // Declaration of pointer to int**

**p = \&a; // Initialization with address of a**

**```**



**### 📌 Explanation:**



**\* `a` is a normal variable with value `10`**

**\* `\&a` gives the \*\*address of `a`\*\***

**\* `p` stores the address of `a`**



**---**



**## ✅ Accessing Values via Pointers (Dereferencing)**



**To get the value stored at the address the pointer holds, use the \*\*dereference operator `\*`\*\*:**



**```c**

**printf("%d", \*p); // Prints 10, the value stored at address p**

**```**



**---**



**## ✅ Full Example: Basic Pointer Use**



**```c**

**#include <stdio.h>**



**int main() {**

**int a = 5;**

**int \*ptr; // Declare pointer**

**ptr = \&a; // Initialize pointer with address of a**



**printf("Value of a: %d\\n", a);**

**printf("Address of a: %p\\n", \&a);**

**printf("Pointer ptr holds address: %p\\n", ptr);**

**printf("Value at address ptr points to: %d\\n", \*ptr);**



**return 0;**

**}**

**```**



**### ✅ Output:**



**```**

**Value of a: 5**

**Address of a: 0x7ffeefbff5cc ← (example, varies)**

**Pointer ptr holds address: 0x7ffeefbff5cc**

**Value at address ptr points to: 5**

**```**



**---**



**## 🟩 Summary Table**



**| Concept | Meaning | Example |**

**| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------- |**

**| Pointer | A variable that stores an address | `int \*p;` |**

**| Address-of (`\&`) | Gets the memory address of a variable | `p = \&a;` |**

**| Dereference (`\*`) | Accesses value stored at pointer’s address | `\*p` |**



**---**



**## 🔧 Common Use Cases of Pointers**



**| Use Case | Example |**

**| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |**

**| Array access | `\*(arr + i)` |**

**| Function arguments by reference | `void swap(int \*a, int \*b);` |**

**| Dynamic memory allocation | `int \*p = malloc(sizeof(int));` |**

**| Data structures (linked lists) | Use pointer to connect nodes |**

**\* For example, to store information about a student (name, age, grade) in one variable.**



**---**



**## ✅ 1. Declaring a Structure**



**Use the `struct` keyword, followed by the structure name and members enclosed in braces.**



**### Syntax:**



**```c**

**struct structure\_name {**

**data\_type member1;**

**data\_type member2;**

**// ...**

**};**

**```**



**### Example:**



**```c**

**struct Student {**

**char name\[50];**

**int age;**

**float grade;**

**};**

**```**



**---**



**## ✅ 2. Defining Structure Variables (Creating Instances)**



**You can declare variables of the structure type like this:**



**```c**

**struct Student s1, s2;**

**```**



**Or combine declaration with definition:**



**```c**

**struct Student {**

**char name\[50];**

**int age;**

**float grade;**

**} s1, s2;**

**```**



**---**



**## ✅ 3. Initializing Structure Members**



**You can initialize members in multiple ways:**



**### Method 1: Assign values after declaration**



**```c**

**s1.age = 20;**

**s1.grade = 85.5;**

**strcpy(s1.name, "Alice");**

**```**



**### Method 2: Use an initializer list at declaration**



**```c**

**struct Student s2 = {"Bob", 22, 90.0};**

**```**



**---**



**## ✅ 4. Accessing Structure Members**



**Use the \*\*dot operator (`.`)\*\* to access members of a structure variable:**



**```c**

**printf("Name: %s\\n", s1.name);**

**printf("Age: %d\\n", s1.age);**

**printf("Grade: %.2f\\n", s1.grade);**

**```**



**---**



**## ✅ Full Example: Structure Usage**



**```c**

**#include <stdio.h>**

**#include <string.h>**



**struct Student {**

**char name\[50];**

**int age;**

**float grade;**

**};**



**int main() {**

**struct Student s1;**



**// Assign values to members**

**strcpy(s1.name, "Alice");**

**s1.age = 20;**

**s1.grade = 88.5;**



**// Access and print members**

**printf("Name: %s\\n", s1.name);**

**printf("Age: %d\\n", s1.age);**

**printf("Grade: %.2f\\n", s1.grade);**



**// Initialize another struct at declaration**

**struct Student s2 = {"Bob", 22, 92.0};**

**printf("\\nName: %s, Age: %d, Grade: %.2f\\n", s2.name, s2.age, s2.grade);**



**return 0;**

**}**

**```**



**### Output:**



**```**

**Name: Alice**

**Age: 20**

**Grade: 88.50**



**Name: Bob, Age: 22, Grade: 92.00**

**```**

**13) Explain the importance of file handling in C. Discuss how to perform file**

**operations like opening, closing, reading, and writing files.**





**Absolutely! Here's a clear explanation of \*\*file handling in C\*\*, why it's important, and how to perform basic file operations.**



**---**



**## ✅ Importance of File Handling in C**



**\* \*\*File handling\*\* lets programs \*\*store data permanently\*\* (beyond the program’s runtime) by reading from and writing to files on disk.**

**\* It’s essential for:**



**\* Saving user data**

**\* Reading configuration or input data**

**\* Logging program activities**

**\* Handling large data sets that don’t fit in memory**



**---**



**## ✅ Basic File Operations in C**



**In C, file handling is done using \*\*file pointers\*\* of type `FILE \*` from the standard library `<stdio.h>`.**



**---**



**### 1. Opening a File**



**Use the `fopen()` function to open a file. It returns a file pointer.**



**```c**

**FILE \*fopen(const char \*filename, const char \*mode);**

**```**



**\* `filename`: Name of the file (string)**

**\* `mode`: How you want to open the file (read, write, append, etc.)**



**| Mode | Meaning |**

**| ------ | ----------------------------------- |**

**| `"r"` | Read (file must exist) |**

**| `"w"` | Write (creates or truncates file) |**

**| `"a"` | Append (write at end) |**

**| `"r+"` | Read and write |**

**| `"w+"` | Write and read (create or truncate) |**

**| `"a+"` | Append and read |**



**---**



**### 2. Closing a File**



**Use `fclose()` to close an open file and release resources.**



**```c**

**int fclose(FILE \*fp);**

**```**



**---**



**### 3. Reading from a File**



**Use functions like `fgetc()`, `fgets()`, or `fread()`.**



**\* \*\*`fgetc()`\*\* reads one character at a time.**

**\* \*\*`fgets()`\*\* reads a line or string.**

**\* \*\*`fread()`\*\* reads raw data.**



**Example with `fgets()`:**



**```c**

**char buffer\[100];**

**fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), fp);**

**```**



**---**



**### 4. Writing to a File**



**Use functions like `fputc()`, `fputs()`, or `fprintf()`.**



**\* \*\*`fputc()`\*\* writes one character.**

**\* \*\*`fputs()`\*\* writes a string.**

**\* \*\*`fprintf()`\*\* writes formatted data (like `printf` but to a file).**



**Example with `fputs()`:**



**```c**

**fputs("Hello, file!\\n", fp);**

**```**



**---**



**## ✅ Full Example: Writing and Reading a Text File**



**```c**

**#include <stdio.h>**



**int main() {**

**FILE \*fp;**



**// Open file for writing**

**fp = fopen("example.txt", "w");**

**if (fp == NULL) {**

**printf("Error opening file!\\n");**

**return 1;**

**}**



**// Write to file**

**fputs("Hello, World!\\n", fp);**

**fputs("This is file handling in C.\\n", fp);**



**// Close file**

**fclose(fp);**



**// Open file for reading**

**fp = fopen("example.txt", "r");**

**if (fp == NULL) {**

**printf("Error opening file!\\n");**

**return 1;**

**}**



**char buffer\[100];**



**// Read and print file contents line by line**

**while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), fp) != NULL) {**

**printf("%s", buffer);**

**}**



**// Close file**

**fclose(fp);**



**return 0;**

**}**

**```**



**### Output:**



**```**

**Hello, World!**

**This is file handling in C.**

**```**



**---**



**## 🟨 Summary**



**| Operation | Function | Purpose |**

**| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |**

**| Open file | `fopen(filename, mode)` | Open a file with a mode |**

**| Close file | `fclose(fp)` | Close the opened file |**

**| Read file | `fgetc()`, `fgets()`, `fread()` | Read data from file |**

**| Write file | `fputc()`, `fputs()`, `fprintf()` | Write data to file |**
