Module 1 – Overview of IT Industry


1.) Explain in your own words what a program is and how it functions.
Ans..--> A program is a set of instructions written in a specific language that a computer can follow to perform a task or solve a problem. Think of it like a recipe — it tells the computer what steps to take, in what order, and under what conditions.

How It Functions:

Written by a human – A programmer writes the code using a programming language (like Python, Java, or C++).

Translated for the computer – The code is converted into a form the computer understands (machine code) by a compiler or interpreter.

Executed step-by-step – The computer reads the instructions and carries them out one by one. These might include:

Doing calculations

Storing or retrieving data

Displaying output

Making decisions (like "if this, do that")

Repeating actions (loops).




2) What are the key steps involved in the programming process?
Ans..--> Key Steps in the Programming Process :

* The programming process involves several key steps that help turn an idea into a working, efficient program.

Key Steps in the Programming Process:



Define the Problem – Understand what the program should do.

Plan the Solution – Design the logic using pseudocode or flowcharts.

Write the Code – Translate the plan into a programming language.

Test the Program – Run it and check for errors.

Debug – Fix any issues or bugs found.

Refine – Improve and clean up the code.

3) What are the main differences between high-level and low-level**

**programminglanguages?**



Ans..-->**High-level languages are user-friendly and good for most applications.

Low-level languages are powerful for system-level programming but harder to use.

4) Describe the roles of the client and server in web communication.**

Ans..--> Client:**

The device or application (like a web browser) that requests information.

It sends a request to the server (e.g., asking for a webpage or data).

**Server:**

A computer or system that responds to the client's requests.

It processes the request and sends back the required information (like an HTML page, image, or data).


5) Explain the function of the TCP/IP model and its layers?**

Ans..--> The TCP/IP model is a set of rules (protocols) that allow computers to communicate over the internet. It breaks down communication into layers, making it easier to design, manage, and troubleshoot networks.

**Application Layer**

Function: Provides services and user interfaces for communication.

Examples: HTTP (web), FTP (file transfer), SMTP (email)



**Transport Layer**

Function: Manages data delivery between devices.



**Protocols:**

TCP (reliable, connection-based)

UDP (faster, connectionless)



**Internet Layer**

Function: Handles addressing and routing of data across networks.

Key Protocol: IP (Internet Protocol)



**Network Access Layer** (or Link Layer)

Function: Deals with physical transmission of data over the network (like cables, Wi-Fi).

Includes: MAC addresses, Ethernet, etc.


6) Explain Client Server Communication ?**

Ans..--> Client-server communication is how devices exchange data on a network, especially over the internet.

**How It Works:**



**Client Sends a Request:**

The client (like a web browser or app) asks for something — e.g., a webpage, file, or data.

This request is sent over the internet to the server.



**Server Processes the Request:**

The server is a powerful computer that listens for requests.

It processes the request, fetches the needed information, and prepares a response.



**Server Sends a Response:**

The server sends the data back to the client (e.g., HTML page, image, or result).



**Client Displays or Uses the Data:**

The client receives the response and shows it to the user or uses it in the application.


7) How does broadband differ from fiber-optic internet?**

Ans..--> Broadband** is a general term for high-speed internet (like DSL or cable).

**Fiber-optic :** is a type of broadband that uses light through glass cables for much faster and more reliable internet.

8) What are the differences between HTTP and HTTPS protocols?**

Ans..--> HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It’s the basic protocol used to transfer data between your browser and websites.**

**HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. It’s the secure version of HTTP.**



**Security:**

HTTP sends data in plain text, which means information like passwords or credit card details can be intercepted by hackers.

HTTPS encrypts the data using SSL/TLS protocols, making the information secure and unreadable to outsiders during transmission.



**URL Indicator:**

Websites using HTTP start with http://.

Websites using HTTPS start with https:// and often show a padlock icon in the browser’s address bar.



**Use Cases:**

HTTP is okay for simple sites where security isn’t critical (like blogs or public info pages).

HTTPS is essential for sites that handle sensitive data, such as online banking, shopping, email, or login pages.



**Trust and SEO:**

Browsers now warn users when visiting non-secure HTTP sites.

HTTPS websites are favored in search engine rankings.

9) What is the role of encryption in securing applications?**

Ans..--> Encryption keeps data safe and private, making sure only the right people
can access and trust the information within an application
